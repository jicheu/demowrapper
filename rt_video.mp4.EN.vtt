00:00:01.462 --> 00:00:04.880 
So, Chris, what are we looking in here in this demo for real-time?

2
00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:12.487 
So, actually, this is a demo that is basically showing the impact of load on the machine

3
00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:17.757 
So we see we are actually spinning irregularly right now

4
00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:22.081 
and it is happening because this is not a real-time demo at this point

5
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.774
The real-time features are not being used and the system is getting a lot of load

6
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:33.573
And that basically gets us unpredictable execution time for the thread that controls the motor

7
00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:41.234
We are now using the real-time features, and we see the wheel spinning very regularly

8
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:48.824
because we are getting a predictable execution of the process that controls the servo

9
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:51.728
Very controlled time slices

10
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:58.092
So this is a feature (TSN and TCC) that we are enabling on the latest generation of our CPUS

11
00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:06.681
We are collaborating with Canonical to bring TSN/TCC onto the real-time Ubuntu offering
